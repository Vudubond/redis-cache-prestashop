# Hs Cache Redis Prestashop module

## Versions : 1.5.x -> 1.6.0.9

Prestashop provides several caching method as memcached, apc, xcache ... 

I propose another method more efficient with Redis (
similar to memcached but more powerful)



### Requirements

 follow the following rules:

* Install redis server ( check http://redis.io/download ) 
* clone the project inside your /modules/
